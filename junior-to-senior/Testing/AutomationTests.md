# Automation Tests

- sometimes will hear end-to-end test. 

- UI tests that runs in a browser or browser-like environment, to simulate user behavior, like clicking, typing, scrolling. 

- need make sure things work from an end user. Need to consider different devices users may have, different versions, etc. So it's hard to cover all scenarios. 

- hardest to set up, expensive. 基本是找专门的公司提供此服务。

- some companies instead of writing the scripts, hire people to actually do the test.
