- the older the code is for a company product, 
  it is more likely to be touched by different developers.
- bug start small but can grow into a big problem. 
- we have Testing. 

- never runs in production, but in development; 
  runs before production to make sure everything behaves as expected. 

```
npm run test
```

- TDD (test driven development: writing tests beforehand)
