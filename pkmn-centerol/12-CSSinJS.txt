flaws of CSS. 

CSS shares one single global namespace. 
e.g. I assigned className 'card' to one element, and
     someone else also assigned the same className 'card'
     to another element without knowing it repeated the className, 
     then they might get the styles I wrote for my element.

React lets us import the stylesheet for visual purposes so we know the 
style sheet is related to the component. But the rules of CSS actually 
has not been changed. 

Solution: 
  > 1. BEM (Block Element Modifier) - follow a certain naming pattern. 
    · issue: can result in very long and nested class name;
  > 2. Style and creating JS object.  
    · issue: cannot access some selectors, like :hover and nth-child. 
  > 3. CSS in JS. 
    · popular library: styled-component
    · cons: 有些人还是习惯css归css, js归js. 
    · pros: performance is well, extremely fast. (does depend on the App. )
