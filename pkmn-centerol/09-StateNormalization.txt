# Data Normalization
- As mentioned before, there are two ways of storing shop data inside our reducer.

- Currently, the data stored is in the form of an array, and we are calling .find() in the
  selector, matching the id based off of the UrlParam we get from our Url. 

  ```
  collections => collections.find(collection => collection.id === COLLECTION_ID_MAP[collectionUrlParam])
  ```

- The issue with .find() is whenever we call it in our array, it will loop through every element. 
  In a worst case scenario, say we have 1000 collections, and the collection we are looking for appears to
  be the last element from the array. It will loop through the whole array until it finds the match at the 
  end, which this results in a performance issue. 

- Instead, we can store it in an object. The concept of storing list of elements inside an object
  instead of an array is called _Data Normalization_. 
  
- Note: the items are still in the form of an array. If we ever want a page for each individual item, 
  then we might convert it to an object as well. But in this project won't be doing so. 
  Just something to better keep note of for my future projects.
