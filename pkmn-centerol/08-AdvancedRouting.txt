# Nested Routing in Shop Page
- Refresher on +match+, +location+ and +history+: 
  > whatever that is wrapped by +Route+ has these three properties: +match+, +location+ and +history+;
  > +Match+:
    · path: (string), the path pattern used to match. Useful for building nested routes.

- **ShopPage** is already in a Route. To render another component inside this route, we will need
  to bring in the match property (match, location history which we have access to from React Router). 


```
<Route exact path={`${match.path}`} component={CollectionsOverview} />
<Route path={`${match.path}/:collectionId`} component={CollectionPage} />

/shop/:collection
```

- The /:collectionId (/:[name]) is a paramater.
