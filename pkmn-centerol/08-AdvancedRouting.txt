# Nested Routing in Shop Page
- **ShopPage** is already in a Route. To render another component inside this route, we will need
  to bring in the match property (match, location history which we have access to from React Router). 

```
<Route exact path={`${match.path}`} component={CollectionsOverview} /> // match.path is '/shop'
<Route path={`${match.path}/:collectionId`} component={CollectionPage} />

// '/:collectionId (/:[name])' is a URL parameter. 
```

- From the info we get from match.params.collectionId, we can pass it into the selector and render the
  specific page. Using the Id and get the correct collection. 

- The caveat is, when we look at the collections' ids, they are in numbers, while the collectionId
  we get from the url parameter is a string.
